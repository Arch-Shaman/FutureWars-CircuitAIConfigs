# FutureWars-CircuitAIConfigs
A repository of circuitAI configs for use with https://github.com/Arch-Shaman/ZK-Futurewars-Mod
These AIs are the only supported AIs for FW. All AIs are added with permission.

# Usage
To use these AIs:

1.) Open steam, right click zero-k in your library and press properties. Click on Installed Files. Click "Browse". Go to AI then Skirmish. If you're not on steam, go to your Zero-K install's location then go to AI then Skirmish. (EG: Zero-K/AI/Skirmish)

2.) https://github.com/Arch-Shaman/FutureWars-CircuitAIConfigs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip download AI from here and drop the folders into your zero-K AI/Skirmish folder.

3.) In your Zero-K install directory, create a new file named "devmode" as a text file (either by creating a file called "devmode.txt" or creating a new text file and naming it "devmode")

4.) Close Zero-K, if it's already open.

5.) (Re)launch Zero-K and in the lobby, go to Settings. If you sucessfully enabled devmode in step 3, you should see a new Developer tab appear. Under this tab, there is a setting called "Simple AI List", disable this and FWBrutal should appear at the top of the AI list. Note: you should use simple AI list when not using custom AIs as running the wrong circuit version may crash your game.

If you have performed the above steps correctly, you should see the new AIs at the top of the list when going to play a game. To uninstall or revert to normal AI list, just check the Simple AI list setting again.
