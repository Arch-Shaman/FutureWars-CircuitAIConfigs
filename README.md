# FutureWars-CircuitAIConfigs
A repository of circuitAI configs for use with https://github.com/Arch-Shaman/ZK-Futurewars-Mod

# Usage
To use these AIs:

1.) Open steam, right click zero-k in your library and press properties. Click on Installed Files. Click "Browse". Go to AI then Skirmish. If you're not on steam, go to your Zero-K install's location then go to AI then Skirmish. (EG: Zero-K/AI/Skirmish)
2.) https://github.com/Arch-Shaman/FutureWars-CircuitAIConfigs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip download AI from here and drop into your zero-K and unzip into this folder.
3.) In your Zero-K install directory, create a new file named "devmode" as a text file (either by creating a file called "devmode.txt" or creating a new text file and naming it "devmode")
4.) Close Zero-K, if it's already open.
5.) (Re)launch Zero-K and in the lobby, go to Settings. If you sucessfully enabled devmode in step 3, you should see a new Developer tab appear. Under this tab, there is a setting called "Simple AI List", disable this and FWBrutal should appear at the top of the AI list. Note: you should use simple AI list when not using custom AIs as running the wrong circuit version may crash your game.
